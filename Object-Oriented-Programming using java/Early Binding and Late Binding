Early Binding: The binding which can be resolved at compile time by the compiler is known as static or early binding.
               Binding of all the static, private and final methods is done at compile-time

Late binding: In the late binding or dynamic binding, the compiler doesnâ€™t decide the method to be called.
              Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding. In overriding both parent and child classes have the same method.
